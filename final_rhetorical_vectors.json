        "The passage begins with John identifying himself as a fellow participant in 'θλίψει καὶ βασιλείᾳ καὶ ὑπομονῇ' (tribulation, kingdom, and endurance), highlighting the 'Lament, Persecution & Endurance' aspect. The core of the passage is the powerful, awe-inspiring vision of the glorified Christ, described with intense imagery like 'φωνὴν μεγάλην ὡς σάλπιγγος' (loud voice like a trumpet), 'ὅμοιον υἱὸν ἀνθρώπου' (like a son of man), and physical attributes like 'λευκαὶ ὡς ἔριον λευκόν, ὡς χιών' (white as white wool, as snow) and 'οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτοῦ ὡς φλὸξ πυρός' (eyes like a flame of fire). This overwhelming manifestation causes John to fall 'πρὸς τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ ὡς νεκρός' (at his feet as though dead), strongly indicating 'Theophanic Awe & Terror'. The divine voice then commands, 'Ὃ βλέπεις γράψον εἰς βιβλίον καὶ πέμψον' (What you see, write in a book and send), and later 'γράψον οὖν ἃ εἶδες καὶ ἃ εἰσὶν καὶ ἃ μέλλει γίνεσθαι μετὰ ταῦτα' (Write therefore what you have seen, and what is and what is to take place after these things), which are clear instances of 'Prophetic Exhortation & Warning'.

        "This passage, comprising the first five letters to the churches, heavily features 'Worship & Praise' through the self-descriptions of Christ (e.g., 'ὁ κρατῶν τοὺς ἑπτὰ ἀστέρας', 'ὁ πρῶτος καὶ ὁ ἔσχατος', 'ὁ ἔχων τὴν ῥομφαίαν τὴν δίστομον τὴν ὀξεῖαν', 'ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ θεοῦ', 'ὁ Ἀμήν'). 'Lament, Persecution & Endurance' is prominent with mentions of 'θλῖψιν' (tribulation), 'ὑπομονήν' (endurance), 'πιστὸς ἄχρι θανάτου' (faithful unto death), and the suffering of the churches.

'Prophetic Exhortation & Warning' is seen in the repeated 'γράψον' (write), 'μνημόνευε' (remember), 'μετανόησον' (repent), and 'κράτει ὃ ἔχεις' (hold fast what you have). 'Theophanic Awe & Terror' is less pronounced but present in descriptions like 'τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ ὡς φλόγα πυρός' (eyes like a flame of fire).",

        "This passage is heavily weighted towards 'Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action' with the descriptions of the trumpet plagues (hail and fire, burning sea, poisoned waters, darkened luminaries, locusts, and the cavalry from the Euphrates) causing widespread destruction ('τὸ τρίτον τῆς γῆς κατεκάη', 'τὸ τρίτον τῆς θαλάσσης αἷμα', 'πολλοὶ τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἀπέθανον').

        "The passage begins with the announcement of the third woe (v. 14), transitioning to the seventh angel's trumpet. The core of the passage is the declaration 'Ἐγένετο ἡ βασιλεία τοῦ κόσμου τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν καὶ τοῦ χριστοῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ βασιλεύσει εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων' (v. 15), which is a clear expression of **Worship & Praise**. This is reinforced by the actions of the twenty-four elders who 'ἔπεσαν ἐπὶ τὰ πρόσωπα αὐτῶν καὶ προσεκύνησαν τῷ θεῷ, λέγοντες · Εὐχαριστοῦμέν σοι, κύριε, ὁ θεός, ὁ παντοκράτωρ...' (v. 16-17), explicitly praising God's sovereignty and reign. The text then describes the divine response to human rebellion: 'καὶ τὰ ἔθνη ὠργίσθησαν, καὶ ἦλθεν ἡ ὀργή σου καὶ ὁ καιρὸς τῶν νεκρῶν κριθῆναι καὶ δοῦναι τὸν μισθὸν τοῖς δούλοις σου... καὶ διαφθεῖραι τοὺς διαφθείροντας τὴν γῆν' (v. 18), which strongly represents **Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action**. The mention of the 'μισθὸν τοῖς δούλοις σου' (v. 18) hints at **Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope** for the faithful. The opening of the heavenly temple and the appearance of the ark, followed by 'ἀστραπαὶ καὶ φωναὶ καὶ βρονταὶ καὶ σεισμὸς καὶ χάλαζα μεγάλη' (v. 19), vividly portrays **Theophanic Awe & Terror** associated with God's presence and judgment. There is no explicit mention of lament, persecution, cosmic warfare, or direct prophetic exhortation in this specific segment.",

The announcement of Babylon's fall (14:8) and the severe warning against worshipping the beast, detailing punishment with 'fire and sulfur' (14:9-11), strongly emphasizes 'Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action'. The mention of 'the patience of the saints' (14:12) and their adherence to God's commands and Jesus' faith points to 'Lament, Persecution & Endurance'. The beatitude for the dead who die in the Lord (14:13) and their rest from labors signifies 'Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope'. The imagery of the harvest and the treading of the winepress, with blood flowing extensively (14:14-20), while depicting divine action, also carries a sense of overwhelming consequence, contributing to 'Theophanic Awe & Terror'. The pronouncements and commands from the angels, such as 'Write!' (14:13) and the angelic calls to reap and tread, fall under 'Prophetic Exhortation & Warning'.
